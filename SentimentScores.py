# SentimentScores.py - In this example, we’re using the VADER sentiment analysis tool from NLTK, which
# is specifically designed for social media and works well on texts with limited context. It gives a
# sentiment score between -1 (negative sentiment) and 1 (positive sentiment). Running this code on the
# sentence “I absolutely love this movie. It’s fantastic!” will give you a sentiment score indicating
# a very positive sentiment.
#
# Please note that you’ll need to have the NLTK library installed and the ‘vader_lexicon’ downloaded
# to run this code. You can install NLTK with pip (pip install nltk) and download ‘vader_lexicon’ using
# the nltk.download() function in the script.
#
# This is a very basic example of what you can do with NLP. More advanced techniques include things
# like language translation, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and much more. NLP is a vast
# field with a wide range of applications in areas like chatbots, translation services, sentiment
# analysis, and information extraction, to name a few.

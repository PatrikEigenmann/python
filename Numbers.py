# Numbers.py - In this game, the program first generates a random number between 1 and 100. Then
# it enters a loop where it asks the user to enter their guess. If the user's guess is too high or
# too low, it tells them so and asks for another guess. If the user's guess is correct, it
# congratulates the user and ends the game. The game also counts the number of tries it took for the
# user to guess the number correctly. If the user enters something that's not a number, the program
# will ask for a valid number.
